PATCHES in the Byte branch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hey there! You found the Byte branch. Well done.

We keep some patches in here:

* byte-compile-against-apache24.diff

Compile against Apache 2.4

* byte-new-packet-type-byte_acc.diff

This is a new FCGI packet type that we invented to transport CPU usage information
from the FCGI process manager to the Apache webserver. You should not apply this
patch if you do not also have the FCGI packet implemented, allthough it should not
hurt to have support for this packet.





README for mod_fastcgi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mod_fastcgi is a module for the Apache web server, that enables
FastCGI - a standards based protocol for communicating with
applications that generate dynamic content for web pages.

FastCGI provides a superset of CGI functionality, but a subset of the
functionality of programming for a particular web server API.
Nonetheless, the feature set is rich enough for programming virtually
any type of web application, but the result is generally more
scalable.  For more information on FastCGI, see

   http://www.fastcgi.com/

For information on installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 1.3.x, see the
file INSTALL.

For information on installing mod_fastcgi with Apache 2.x, see the
file INSTALL.AP2.

For information on configuring an installed instance of mod_fastcgi,
see the file mod_fastcgi.html in the docs/ directory, also available
online at:
